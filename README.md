# WAF gate

Untrusted input is a request; it can only ever become one of a fixed set of decisions over a
closed type, never a tool argument. An injected instruction cannot be represented in the
closed type, so it is rejected — proven at compile time by `check`, and clamped again at
run time by the `extract` domain check.

- **Untrusted input:** `fetch<web>` — a request
- **Closed type:** `type Decision = Filter(WafVerdict) | LogW` where `WafVerdict` is closed
- **Sink / capability:** `grant filterReq confidence 70` → `privileged { filterReq(d) }`
- **Consequence axes:** Trust, Confidence

## Run the demo

```sh
examples/apps/waf-gate/demo.sh
```

The safe agent proves `SAFE`, runs on a benign input, and **rejects an injection
payload at the trust boundary (exit 3)**. The vulnerable version proves `UNSAFE` — it
never compiles to a runnable agent.

## Files

- `waf-gate_safe.os` — the correct design.
- `waf-gate_unsafe.os` — the tempting-but-wrong version (the negative example a model must learn to reject).
- `ondos.toml` — the project manifest (each app is a self-contained Ondos project).
